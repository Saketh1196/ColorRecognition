# ColorRecognition

In this project, an image is taken with different colours in it. A dataset containing different colors along with different colornames are used and is used as a csv file. The intensity values of the colors are also listed in the dataset. A function is created to detect the color along with individual intensity values of Red, BLue and Green. When clicked on a specific color, the colorname along with intensity values of red, blue , green are displayed on the image. The change in value and colors are displayed from the gif below.
